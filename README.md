**Task Manager**



A simple and interactive command-line application built with Node.js to manage daily tasks.



**Why I built this**



I created this project to demonstrate my understanding of core programming concepts as part of my journey towards a software engineering apprenticeship. It showcases my ability to:

* Handle user input in a terminal environment.
* Manage data using Arrays and Objects.
* Implement control flow with loops and conditional logic. 
* Use Git and GitHub for version control.



**Features**



* Add Tasks: Prompts the user to enter new items into a list. 
* View List: Displays all current tasks in a readable format. 
* Exit: Closes the application. 



**How to run this program:**

1. Clone the repository to your machine.
2. Install the necessary dependency: npm install
3. Start the application: node app.js
